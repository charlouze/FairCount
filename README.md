# Faircount

Free tricount like application. 
If you want to use/try it, go to https://faircount.web.app. 
PWA can be installed to your smartphone.

I won't pay for hosting it, so it can be broken due to Firebase free quota exceeded.

I assume it can be deployed to any firebase project if you want to keep it private.

## Context

We were using tricount with my family but we had to pay for it.
I wanted to try building a PWA using angular and firebase with its firestore DB.
So here it is ! ;)

## Community

You can help building a better app by proposing PRs or you can ask for new features using issues.

Have fun, cheers
